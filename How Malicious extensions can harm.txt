How Malicious extensions can harm users: 

Malicious browser extensions can be highly dangerous and can harm users in a variety of ways, often without being immediately obvious. Here's how they can do damage:

---

### 1. Data Theft

* **Stealing login credentials:** They can capture usernames and passwords entered on websites.
* **Accessing sensitive information:** Extensions can read everything you type or view on a webpage, including emails, messages, and payment information.
* **Harvesting personal data:** Extensions may collect your name, email, address, browsing history, or even files you upload.

---

### 2. Browser Hijacking

* **Changing search engine or homepage:** Some extensions alter browser settings to redirect users to ad-laden or phishing sites.
* **Injecting ads or pop-ups:** They can display unwanted ads or affiliate links to generate revenue fraudulently.
* **Redirecting to malicious websites:** Users may be sent to phishing sites designed to trick them into giving up sensitive information.

### 3. Surveillance and Spying

* **Keystroke logging:** Some malicious extensions can record every key you press.
* **Monitoring browsing behavior:** Tracking what websites you visit, how long you stay, and what you click on can build a detailed profile of you.
* **Taking screenshots or screen recordings:** With the right permissions, extensions can capture what’s on your screen.

### 4. System Exploitation

* **Executing arbitrary code:** If the extension updates dynamically (from a remote server), attackers can push malicious code anytime.
* **Serving as a backdoor:** Some extensions act as a foothold for attackers to further compromise your system or network.

### 5. Financial Harm

* **Cryptojacking:** Using your device’s resources to mine cryptocurrency without your knowledge.
* **Scams and frauds:** Redirecting users to fake websites that mimic real ones to steal payment or identity info.

### 6. Exploiting Permissions

Even legitimate-looking extensions can abuse permissions like:

* `tabs`: Access all your open tabs.
* `webRequest`: Monitor and manipulate web requests.
* `cookies`: Read session cookies and impersonate you on websites.
* `storage`: Save and access potentially sensitive data.

### How to Stay Safe:

1. **Only install from trusted developers.**
2. **Check permissions carefully** — don’t install if the permissions seem excessive.
3. **Read reviews and ratings.**
4. **Keep extensions to a minimum** — the fewer you have, the lower your risk.
5. **Use browser security features** like extension control or sandboxing.
6. **Regularly review installed extensions** and remove anything suspicious or unused.
